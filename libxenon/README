This will be the "lightweight embedded gaming-console os" which doesn't have 
a name yet.

I've thought of the directory structure as the following:

drivers/ containing code for both single-platform and cross platform
devices and frameworks. Like "xenon_uart", "ochi", "fat".

ports/ are applications. We should provide "hello world" binaries, examples
and all of that.

startup/ contains startup codes, which are likely to be shared between
applications.

We need some serious Makefile-foo so we can properly include what we want
and what we don't want for a certain port.
